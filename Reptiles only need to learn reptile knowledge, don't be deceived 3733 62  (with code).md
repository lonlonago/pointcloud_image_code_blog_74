###  foreword 

With the advent of the era of big data, more and more technologies have been taken seriously by enterprises in line with the development of the times and have begun to be applied to the field. Crawler technology is undoubtedly one of the best. Many students are learning this technology whether they are employed or interested. 

Reptiles only need to learn reptile knowledge? It's not that simple. Generally, most of the people who tell you these crash ideas have other intentions. As a retired programmer with more than ten years of service, I personally think that mastering reptiles involves 8 aspects of knowledge!

 Today I'm going to tell you, "What skills do a qualified herpetologist need to learn?" What skills should we focus on mastering?  

###  First, the Python language 

Importance ：★★★★★（ top priority) 

Any technology needs language to support. Among the many computer programming languages, Python is undoubtedly the most suitable for crawling. The most suitable does not mean that it is the only one. Other languages such as Java, C, etc. can be used for crawling development, but Python has unique advantages compared with these languages. Here we will not introduce it in detail. Students who do not know can go to the Internet to learn about it. There are many materials.

 The Python language is the foundation. As long as you have a solid grasp of the basic knowledge at this stage, there will be no problem in the later learning. Then one of the more important knowledge points at this stage is the "object-oriented programming idea". This knowledge point is also the most difficult at this stage. Therefore, students can spend more time on this stage of the Python language, and the content of this piece can be spent more time appropriately. Otherwise, you will always feel that you will hate less when you read it.  

###  Front-end knowledge 

Importance: ★ ★ (understand) 

This content is for understanding. Because we are not doing front-end, we don't need to put too much energy into this part of the content, but we must understand the basic page tags and structure. In the future, when grabbing data, it is necessary to analyze the page. Of course, students who have energy can study it a little deeper. After all, the more you master, the more beneficial the development of crawlers will be. The learning of this part of the content is still reasonably arranged according to your own situation 

###  III. Network programming 

Importance: ★ ★ ★ (learning) 

To be honest, network programming is still a relatively important piece of content. If some students sort out this piece of knowledge more clearly, then the entire crawler process will be very clear. 

![avatar]( 20210421155203599.jpg) 

 Returning to the topic, our main job is crawling. So for this part of the content, we only need to learn basic network programming knowledge. For example: network communication protocols (especially http and https), network request methods, network request and response processes, and so on.  

###  IV. Data storage 

Importance ： ★★★★★（ top priority) 

The importance of data storage is self-evident. Crawling development, part of the work is Crawling the data, the other part also requires us to store data. 

![avatar]( 20210421155418358.jpg) 

 In this section, in addition to the common storage methods such as json, txt, html, etc., you must also master csv and mongodb, especially mongodb is almost a storage method that you must know when you go to an enterprise for an interview; there are also mysql and redis, although mongodb can solve most of the needs. But knowing more storage technologies is definitely good for your own competitiveness.  

###  V. data analytics 

Importance ： ★★★☆（ Mastery) 

How to say this? Strictly speaking, it is not our job responsibility for crawler development, but now many companies have such a demand for crawler development engineers, which means that our threshold is getting higher and higher. 

![avatar]( 20210421155632595.jpg) 

 Then about the content of this part, students can put it to the last stage to learn when they study. Probably the technologies that need to be mastered include numpy, pandas, missingno, jieba and so on.  

###  JavaScript language 

Importance: ★ ★ ★ (learning) 

We learn Python language to facilitate the development of crawlers, so why learn js? 

![avatar]( 2021042115583415.jpg) 

 This problem is very simple. Now more and more web pages will have some js encryption. Then it will cause a big obstacle for us to go to Crawling the data. However, we are going to learn a js language, obviously the learning achievement is too high. So giving it 3 stars does not mean that it is not important, but the learning cost is relatively high at present. If there are students who want to learn js reverse, this content can also be learned later. And now enterprises require us to be familiar with js encryption and understand python common execution js methods, such as pyv8. That's it.  

###  Seven, mobile end technology 

Importance ： ★★★★（ Mastery) 

Nowadays, for a qualified crawler development engineer, it is far from enough to simply crawl the data on the web. With the development of the Internet, the data on mobile devices is more valuable. Therefore, the technical points of this piece are still very important. So what technologies do we all learn? 

First of all, the basic knowledge of android needs to be simply learned, such as what controls andrond has, etc.; secondly, it is necessary to master UIAutomator2; finally, master the usage of package capture tools such as fiddler, etc 

![avatar]( 20210421160435221.jpg) 

 Of course, I would like to add that the technical points are only general directions, and there are still many details that need to be learned. Here is just a reference for you to learn.  

###  Eight, reptile knowledge 

Importance ： ★★★★★（ top priority) 

Here comes the most important piece. Reptile technology is the foundation of our survival as reptile development engineers. Then let's talk about what technologies we need to master in general: 

◆ Proficient in web parsing technologies such as regular, Xpath, bs4, etc 

◆ Study crawler strategies and anti-blocking rules, solve difficulties such as blocking accounts, blocking IPs, and page jumps, and improve the efficiency and quality of web crawling 

◆ Familiar with verification code recognition, simulated login, data cleaning, deduplicate, warehousing, etc 

![avatar]( 20210421161329723.jpg) 

 Proficient in the Scrapy framework and distributed crawlers, it is not difficult to find through the above list of knowledge points, which mainly include four aspects: web page analysis, anti-crawl technology, data warehousing, and the Scrapy framework. To learn well in each aspect, there are certain difficulties. This requires us to accumulate more in our usual learning, so as to achieve flexible application of knowledge points.

  The text of the article has ended here. I just want to thank some of the people who read my article. 

I have been learning how to write articles since I retired. To be honest, every time I see some readers' responses in the background, I feel very relieved, so I want to contribute some of my collection of programming dry goods to everyone, giving back to every reader, hoping to help you. 

Dry goods mainly include: 

① More than 2,000 Python e-books (both mainstream and classic books should be available) 

② Python standard library information (the most complete Chinese version) 

③ Project source code (40 or 50 interesting and classic practice projects and source code) 

④ Python basic introductory videos, etc. (suitable for Xiaobai to learn)
