##  5.2.1 build a holistic understanding 

When learning programming for beginners, beginners must first establish an overall understanding of the knowledge they have learned, learn its skeleton, and then explore the details. After establishing an overall understanding and understanding its general structure, they will roughly know what to learn in this programming language. How well you learn, see the real chapter from the details. The details of knowledge can be seen that a person's foundation is not solid. Take variables in Python as an example, most beginners know how to define a Python variable. What are the variables, and ask their essence, but few beginners can answer. 

##  5.2.2 core parts of the Python language 

The purpose of this section is to provide a general introduction to the core components of the Python language, and each learning component will be explained in detail in subsequent chapters. 

(1) Language foundation 

The language foundation in Python mainly covers variable definitions, code comments, expressions, statements, etc. When learning Python, first lay the foundation of this programming language, and then build high-rise buildings. 

>  Learning is layered and a process from easy to difficult. 

(2) Process control 

Flow control mainly learns about control structures in Python. Control structures in the programming language are used to control the execution logic of code. Control structures in Python include conditional control, loop control, and steering control. 

>  In conditional control, the code in the branch is executed by judging whether the condition is true or false. In loop control, the code in the program can be executed repeatedly. In turn control, the execution process of loop structures and functions can be controlled. 

(3) Data types and functions 

When learning data types, first learn the concept of data types, understand what data types are, and then master the definition and usage of data types in programming languages. Data types in Python can be divided into simple data types and composite data types. Simple data types in Python are integer, floating point, and boolean. Composite data types in Python include string, list, tuple, dictionary, and collection. 

>  Integer, floating-point, string, and other data types are built-in data types in Python. Through classes, we can customize data types. 

Functions are also a data type. In programming, code that needs to be reused can be encapsulated into a function, so that it can be called directly the next time it is used, without rewriting. 

>  Students can understand a function as a converter from input to output. For example, a language translator is a function that outputs one language to another. 

(5) object oriented 

In Python, everything is an object. Built-in data types, functions, files, etc. are all objects. Before mastering the knowledge of object oriented, you need to understand what abstract data types are. Abstract data types are abstractions of data, and their core is to define the structure of data and how to operate on it. 

>  The so-called object refers to the instantiation of this abstract data type. In Python, this abstract data type is represented by a class type. 

(6) Document processing 

File processing in programming refers to the use of the interface provided by the operating system to read and write files. 

>  In the section on file processing, students will learn the types of files, their functions, and how to manipulate files through the open method provided by Python. 

(6) Exception handling 

Exceptions occur during program execution, and how to handle them when they occur, as well as how to customize exceptions, are the main topics to be learned in this section. 

(8) Module processing 

Modules are the core content of Python, and a Python script file corresponds to a module. 

>  In Python files, variables, functions, class types, etc. can be defined as attributes of the module. In Python, other modules can be imported inside the module through the import statement. In the actual development process, commonly used attributes and functions can be written into a separate module for use by other modules, thus realizing reuse. 

(9) Concurrent programming 

The concurrent execution of a program refers to having multiple execution units execute simultaneously or alternately to improve overall performance. 

>  In concurrent programming in Python, we will learn the concepts of processes, threads, coroutines, and the IO model. To become a good Python backend programmer, concurrent programming is a knowledge difficulty that must be overcome. 

(10) Network programming 

The concurrent execution of a program refers to having multiple execution units execute simultaneously or alternately to improve overall performance. In Python concurrent programming, we will learn the concepts of processes, threads, coroutines, and the IO model. To become a good Python backend programmer, concurrent programming is a knowledge difficulty that must be overcome. 

(11) Log processing 

Log processing in a program refers to recording the running process of the program and user behavior to a log file to facilitate later error troubleshooting and data statistics. 

(12) unit test 

After the program is developed, as a qualified programmer, you need to perform unit tests on the code. 

>  Unit test refers to the inspection and verification of the smallest unit in the program to test whether the function provided by the unit is correct. Usually a function in Python is used as a minimum test unit. 

(13) Standard Library 

The standard library in python is a built-in module in python. The python standard library is very large, and we only need to learn a few commonly used standard libraries. 

>  System related standard library, time processing standard library, command line related standard library, mathematical processing standard library, data persistence standard library
