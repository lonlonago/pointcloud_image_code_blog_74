If you want to learn programming by yourself, be sure to bookmark these 7 websites. There are many free high-quality tutorials above, which can save you tens of thousands of dollars in tuition! 

Without further ado, go straight to the dry goods! 

###  The first one, W3school. 

A website that focuses on graphic tutorials, whether it is front-end development of HTML, CSS, or databases, or the learning of programming languages such as Python, has everything, and the key is free. I think as a website, it doesn't have to be so good.

###  Second, Chinese university MOOCs. 

There are many free national-level programming courses on it. Some university teachers offer free courses on it in order to complete teacher indicators or gain reputation. For example, if you want to learn Python, you can search for it. There are many national high-quality Python courses on it.

  Eh, you can learn high-quality human courses without paying tuition, isn't this better than an enrollment brochure?

###  Third, Bilibili. 

Also known as Bilibili, although the above is mixed, there are many interesting programmers who teach their own experience, such as technical fat and other up masters. 

Another advantage of Bilibili is that if you are tired and sleepy from studying, you don't need to drink Dongpeng special drink, change the channel to see the dancing up master, and you will feel like you are doing it again.

However, I suggest that you should keep your eyes open for the five or six hundred Python courses. Some five or six hundred sections have not yet finished teaching Python functions. How can there be so much content to talk about? It's all cut out to make up the number of courses.

###  Fourth, Cainiao tutorial 

This is also a website that focuses on graphic tutorials, and it is also purely free. There are web development and various language learning. I personally feel that the typesetting is more comfortable than W3school, and the content is more detailed. 

I thought W3school was already invincible, but I didn't expect anyone to be braver than him. Whose website is this?

###  Fifth, CSDN. 

Although CSDN was often exposed to a large number of plagiarism and other shortcomings, it did not affect the fact that it was the largest gathering place for domestic programmers. There were also many excellent programmer bloggers who were constantly updating, such as the blogger "Where did the hero come out" in the field of algorithms. 

Of course, you can also go to the Python graphic tutorial written by Uncle Long, which is interesting and not boring.

###  Sixth, the buckle. 

Most programmers learn algorithms here, and there are many different levels of learners posting in the discussion forum. It's a good idea to go here.

###  Number seven, NowCoder. 

Most programmers will come here to brush the questions when looking for a job. Not only are there many pen interview questions from well-known enterprises, but they can also simulate the written test. If you are not confident in finding a job, then brush the questions more! There are also many big names on it, and maybe you can get referrals.

###  Conclusion 

Learning programming has never happened overnight. Those who tell you that they can master a language in a few days are all fooling people. 

I like Python very much, and I have collected a lot of technical dry goods, which can be shared with friends who like my articles. If you are willing to take the time to study, they will definitely help you. The dry goods include:
